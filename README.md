Sprint 11 - Clustering

Due to difficulties running the clustering algorithms on my own computer, I did these exercises with a mix of Jupyter notebooks running locally to scale the data and run a PCA. Then I imported the data created from those notebooks into a hosted runtime in Google Colab notebooks to peform clustering analysis on both the scaled data and the PCA data.


Practice and become familiar with clustering algorithms.

Level 1
	•	Exercise 1: Group the different flights using the K-means algorithm.
	
Level 2
	•	Exercise 2: Group the different flights using the hierarchical clustering algorithm.
	
Level 3
	•	Exercise 3: Calculate clustering performance using a parameter such as silhouette.
